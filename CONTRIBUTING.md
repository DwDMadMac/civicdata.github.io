### How to get started ###

This repository uses Jekyll and Ruby on Rails to create a static website with our content. If this is your first time contributing to the CDA website and you have not previously done any work using Ruby on Rails or Jekyll, you will need to make sure you have the following items installed: Ruby, Rails, Jekyll, Bundler.

- Ruby/Rails: Install following the instructions that can be found for your operating system at http://www.gorails.com.
- Jekyll/Bundler: Install following the instructions that can be found at: http://www.jekyllrb.com after installing Ruby on Rails.

Depending on your operating system, this may also require the installation of other supporting libraries such as XCode (Mac OSX).
