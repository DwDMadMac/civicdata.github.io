__Civic Data Alliance and Data for Democracy are participating in an onsite event for the [Data for Good Exchange #D4GX 2018 - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/) event. Louisville, KY is one of the few cities to host and onsite hacakthon for this event and we'd love for you to join us!__

Join CDA and Data for Democracy in a hackathon for the #D4GX with a focus on the [__Global Data Ethics Pledge__](http://datafordemocracy.org/pledge) (GDEP).

The Pledge is a global initiative aimed to create the most widely adopted framework and community for ethics in data science.

We will be workshopping ideas on how to get people to adopt the Pledge for their projects, organizations and companies, how to best spread the word about the GDEP, encouraging other to join in the project, and actively gathering more signatures.

Join the movement today. Become a data defender for life.

Y'all can [__sign the pledge__](http://datafordemocracy.org/pledge) right now.

As always, with every single CDA meetup, you can bring your own project to hack on or just come and hang out.
