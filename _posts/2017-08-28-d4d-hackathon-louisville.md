# Annual Data for Democracy Hackathon in Louisville
[__Data For Democracy__](http://datafordemocracy.org/) has announced the next Data For Democracy Global Hackathon and Louisville is one of only nine cities hosting an onsite event, so yasssss!  

<a class="button" target="_blank" style="color: #2C2D30;font-weight: bold;border-radius: 3px; background: #00c9cf; padding: 10px;text-align:center;" alt="Register Here!" title="hackathon tickets" href="https://www.meetup.com/Louisville-Civic-Data-Alliance/events/242296870/">Get your tickets</a>

Come represent the Ville and hack with [__Data For Democracy__](http://datafordemocracy.org/), [__Black Lives Matter Louisville__](https://www.facebook.com/blacklivesmatterlouisville/), [__Mijente__](http://mijente.net/) and [__Civic Data Alliance__](http://www.cividataalliance.org) for D4D's global hackathon at the always awesome space, LouieLab.  

This is a hackathon to confront data security issues faced by those who are targets of threats and violence from the alt-right. At this event, different groups will share the unique data security threats they face from the alt-right. As a community, we will identify ways and attempt to build solutions to counter these efforts.  

All skill levels are welcome, come out and get involved!  

The Hackathon will conclude with a showcase on Oct 1, 3 pm EST, when the D4D community will display and demonstrate what they built during the Hackathon, in a series of short presentations.  

Don’t worry about not knowing anyone?—by the end of the Hackathon, you will. Anyone can participate, [_click here_](https://www.meetup.com/Louisville-Civic-Data-Alliance/events/242296870/) to get your free event tickets.  

We're looking forward to building something awesome with you!
